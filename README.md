# Edge Flow Hypothesis Tests

Welcome to the **Edge Flow Hypothesis Tests** repository. This project focuses on hypothesis testing in edge flows and includes various datasets, covariance matrices, and confidence interval computations.

## 📚 Project Structure

### 1. `CI` Folder
- Contains covariance matrices.
- Includes bootstrapped confidence intervals derived from the data.

### 2. `Datasets` Folder
- Houses all datasets related to this project:
  - **Processed Datasets**
  - **Raw Datasets**
  - **Synthetic Datasets**

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Edge-Flow-Hypothesis-Tests.git
cd Edge-Flow-Hypothesis-Tests
# Install required dependencies (if any)
```

## 🚀 Roadmap

The following tasks are planned for future development:

- **Data Analysis**: Additional hypothesis testing with more complex models.
- **New Datasets**: Inclusion of real-world datasets for broader applicability.
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Step-by-step guides for using the tools and interpreting results.

## 📂 Folders and Files Overview

- `CI/`: Contains all covariance matrices and the resulting bootstrapped confidence intervals.
- `Datasets/`: Stores processed, raw, and synthetic datasets used in the analysis.
