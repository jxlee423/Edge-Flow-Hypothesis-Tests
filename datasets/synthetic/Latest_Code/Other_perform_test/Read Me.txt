testAll takes in
  a matrix of subgraph_flows, where each column corresponds to an edge class,
  a subgraph, where a 1 represents connected edges, and a 0 represents disjoint edges,
  and an alpha value.
and outputs whether or not the result of the test is fail to reject the null.
testAll relies on the functions, test1, test2, and test3, which in turn rely on the function slope_ci
Note that subgraph_flows needs to be computed outside of the testAll function.
