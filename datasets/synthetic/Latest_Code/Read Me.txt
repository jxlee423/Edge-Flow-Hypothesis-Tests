Sampler Code Guide:

Use the code in this folder to generate synthetic samplers. The code is pretty efficient. It can easily generate many graphs from any of the three families with up to 10^4 nodes and 10^5 edges. For reasonable default ranges, look at the presets in "Flow_Examples."

To run:

1. "Flow_Examples" this is a script which, when run, calls the sampler. Use this script to store parameter range settings and to save results to a file.

2. "Random_Flow_Sampler" this is the function that performs the sampling. It structures the parameter sets to test, calls a graph sampler, then passes those graphs to a flow sampler, do the test and show the test retults in the end.

Explaination for the rest

1. "subgraph_selecting" this is the function that extracts subgraph from the graph and locates the indice. It is easily to add new subgraph types. and the function subgraph_edges and matched_edges should be used as a pair. each pair represents a different subgraph type.

2. "perform_test" this is the function that perform the test. (it is designed for doing different tetss, eg: united_test, sepperated_tests, different test methods). It is easily to add new tests.

3. "gtrieScanner_mex" is the function to call and run gtrieScanner(the subgraph classifying program)

## The program gtrieScanner is an external software package that uses the g-trie data structure to count occurrences of subgraphs on larger graphs, determining if they are network motifs. (the software link:http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/gtries/) 

## The reason why I design the MEX file is to ensure the program can be run in the Windows System and be used in the sampler process to avoid doing sampler,selecting subgraph,doing tests sepereatedly. the software needs to be run the in the Linux System.

!! I don't have a macbook so to make sure the whole program can also be run the MacOS System, please modify the existed code. please tell me if any help needed.

## Another special issue in the sampler design is that I have to create a function that can create (edge_to_endpoints) txt file for every new generated graph. And the subgraph searching software can analyse the txt files and output new files to letting subgraph selecting function to use.

## In this case make sure to change the txt generated file path based on your own computer path in "Random_Flow_Sampler.m".
